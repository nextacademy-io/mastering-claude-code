# Task 07 — The `clash-feature` skill

> Part: Control the context · Reset branch: `07-start`

## You will end up with

A skill at `.claude/skills/clash-feature/SKILL.md` that holds the recipe for adding a
feature to CLASH, and one small feature shipped with it: venue favourites.

## Why

A skill is for work you keep explaining again and again. Adding a feature to CLASH is
always the same eleven steps in the same order. The easiest step to forget is the ownership
check in the Server Action. A skill turns "remember the check" into "the recipe has a slot for it".

A skill is advice. It loads only when its description matches what you ask. Custom slash
commands in `.claude/commands/*.md` still work. Skills are the richer format for new work.

## Do this

1. Look at what already ships: `.agents/skills/` and `skills-lock.json`. These are
   third-party skills for Prisma, shadcn and React. You are not starting cold.
2. Create the skill file and write the header first.
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: clash-feature
   description: Add a complete feature to CLASH, from Prisma model through an
     authorized Server Action to a rendered page. Use when adding or extending
     a user-facing feature in this codebase.
   allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Bash(npm run *) Bash(npx prisma *) Bash(npx tsc *)
   ---
   ```
3. Write the body as eleven steps, the last one verifies. Keep each step short.
   Prisma model → migration → constants → Zod schema in `lib/validation.ts` → read helper
   in `lib/data/` → Server Action in `app/actions/` **with its own ownership check** →
   page → shadcn component → `revalidatePath` → notification via `lib/notify.ts`.
4. In the Server Action step, say why the check is its own step.
   ```
   Walk me through why the Server Action step in this skill insists on its own
   authorization check, given the layout already calls requireUser().
   ```
   Put the answer into the skill in two sentences.
5. Use the skill to ship a feature.
   ```
   /clash-feature Add venue favourites: a user can favourite a venue from its
   detail page and see a list of their favourites on their profile.
   ```
6. Run the gates.
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm run build
   ```
7. Run `/context`. Compare with the number from task 06. Note how many files Claude read this time.
8. Package the skill as a plugin, so it can be shared outside this repo.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p clash-feature-plugin/.claude-plugin
   cp -r .claude/skills/clash-feature clash-feature-plugin/skills/clash-feature
   ```
   Write `clash-feature-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:
   ```json
   { "name": "clash-feature-plugin", "description": "Add a feature to CLASH, end to end.", "version": "1.0.0" }
   ```
   Load it and try the skill under its new name.
   ```bash
   claude --plugin-dir ./clash-feature-plugin
   ```
   ```
   /clash-feature-plugin:clash-feature
   ```

## Now you

- Ship a second small feature with the skill only: clash comments. Say as little as you can. See how much the skill already knows.
- Add a **Checklist** section at the end of the skill. Every item must be something you can verify by looking.

## Check

- [ ] `.claude/skills/clash-feature/SKILL.md` exists with `name`, `description` and `allowed-tools`.
- [ ] The Server Action step names an ownership check, not only `requireUser()`.
- [ ] Venue favourites work end to end.
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass.
- [ ] You can say why `.claude/commands/*.md` files still work.
- [ ] `claude --plugin-dir ./clash-feature-plugin` starts, and `/clash-feature-plugin:clash-feature` runs the same skill.

## Stuck?

`git checkout 07-start` — the reference CLASH with the task 06 `CLAUDE.md`. The vendored `.agents/skills/`
folder is there; `.claude/skills/` is not.

## Go further

Compare your skill with `workshop-artifacts/07-clash-feature-skill/SKILL.md` in the workshop repository.
Then run `/skill-doctor` again and check that your description is specific enough to match.
