# Task 12 — Letting go

> Part: Orchestrate and let go · Reset branch: `12-start`

## You will end up with

Two agents working on CLASH at the same time in separate worktrees, and a GitHub Action
that runs the security audit on every pull request without anyone watching.

## Why

So far every agent shared one working tree. Worktrees give each agent its own copy on its
own branch, so two agents cannot break each other's half-done work. This is the thing you
will use most.

Headless means nobody watches turn by turn. The same agent, started by an event instead of a
keystroke. Every control from this workshop carries over: a scoped prompt, limited tools, hooks.

## Do this

**Worktrees**

1. Start a session in its own worktree.
   ```bash
   claude --worktree avatar-followup
   ```
   This creates `.claude/worktrees/avatar-followup/` on a new branch `worktree-avatar-followup`
   and starts Claude Code inside it. `-w` is the short flag.
2. In a second terminal, start another one.
   ```bash
   claude --worktree digest-sketch
   ```
3. Give each a small job.
   ```
   (first) Sketch what moving avatars to external storage would change in
   lib/auth.ts, app/actions/profile.ts and the profile page. Write the sketch
   to docs/plans/avatar-storage.md. Do not change app code.
   ```
   ```
   (second) Add a docs/plans/digest.md that describes a weekly digest page
   for the current user. Do not change app code.
   ```
4. Check that neither session sees the other's uncommitted files. Different branch, different folder.
5. Two related things to know: `isolation: worktree` in a subagent's header runs that subagent in its
   own worktree. The `EnterWorktree` and `ExitWorktree` tools let an agent do this itself mid-session.

**Headless in CI**

6. CLASH has no `.github/workflows/` folder. Nothing runs on a pull request yet.
7. Ask for the workflow. Do not put `claude -p` in the YAML. Use the maintained action.
   ```
   Write a GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/security-audit.yml that
   runs on every pull_request. Use anthropics/claude-code-action@v1 (not @beta).
   Pass a prompt asking Claude to audit every exported Server Action in
   app/actions/ changed by the PR for missing ownership checks on mutations of
   existing rows, and to comment the findings on the PR. Authenticate with a
   claude_code_oauth_token repository secret. Grant the permissions the action
   needs, including id-token: write.
   ```
8. Read the file. The `prompt` input is the same brief as task 08. `claude_args` carries model
   and turn limits. The secret is named, never pasted. v1 dropped the `mode` input. `@beta` is the old version.
9. Create the token for the secret: `claude setup-token`. Add it to the repository as
   `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. You do not need it to check that the YAML is valid.

## Now you

- Run `claude --worktree "#<pr-number>"` against an open pull request and see where the worktree starts.
- Extend the workflow: run the saved dynamic workflow from task 09 instead of a single prompt.

## Check

- [ ] `claude --worktree <name>` created a folder under `.claude/worktrees/` and a branch `worktree-<name>`.
- [ ] Two sessions worked at the same time without touching each other's files.
- [ ] `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` exists and runs on `pull_request`.
- [ ] It uses `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`, not `@beta`, and no raw `claude -p` step.
- [ ] The secret is referenced by name. `id-token: write` is in `permissions`.

## Stuck?

`git checkout 12-start` — the reference CLASH with fix, skill, `CLAUDE.md` and hooks.

## Go further

Look at `/loop` for a prompt that repeats on an interval, `/remote-control` for driving a session
from your phone, and `/background` to detach this session and keep it running. `claude agents`
(the CLI command, not a slash command) lists what is already running in the background. Pick
one and try it on CLASH.
