# Task 11 — The TDD inner loop

> Part: Orchestrate and let go · Reset branch: `11-start`
> Slides: https://mastering-claude-code.vercel.app/task-11

## Theory

- [A skill that stops itself](https://mastering-claude-code.vercel.app/theory-tdd-cycle)
- [The spec is the goalpost](https://mastering-claude-code.vercel.app/theory-goalpost-not-target)

> **Reminder:** A test written against a saved spec is a contract; a test written from chat memory drifts — drive the implementation, never the test.

## You will end up with

`lib/capacity.ts` implementing `decideParticipation` correctly against every rule in
`docs/specs/clash-capacity.md`, one rule at a time, driven by a `.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`
skill — and one moment where you watched a careless prompt quietly break the point of a test.

## Why

Told "make the failing test pass," a model will edit whichever file is easier to change —
sometimes that's the test, and the suite goes green for nothing. Real TDD makes the constraint
explicit: drive the implementation, never the test. A saved spec is what makes this possible —
the test is checked against the spec's rule, not against whatever the model remembers from
earlier in the conversation.

This branch already has vitest installed, one trivial passing test, and a deliberately wrong
`lib/capacity.ts` stub. Fighting test-runner configuration live is a detour, not the lesson.

## Do this

1. Confirm the harness already works.
   ```bash
   npm install      # CLASH's 11-start adds vitest to package.json
   npm run test
   ```
   One green test. Nothing to configure.
2. Read the spec together: `@docs/specs/clash-capacity.md`.
3. Look at `lib/capacity.ts`. `decideParticipation` always returns `"waitlisted"` — deliberately
   wrong, so the first real test fails for the right reason: an assertion, not a missing import.
4. Write one failing test by hand for the first rule.
   ```
   Write ONE failing test in lib/capacity.test.ts for the rule "must accept a
   join while accepted participants are below capacity", from
   @docs/specs/clash-capacity.md. Do not implement decideParticipation or
   change lib/capacity.ts — it must still fail.
   ```
   Run `npm run test`. Confirm it's red on an assertion, not a compile error.
5. Watch. Your trainer sends this once, live, on their own machine. Do not send it yourself —
   you run the real version starting at the next step.
   ```
   The test in lib/capacity.test.ts is failing. Update the test so the suite passes.
   ```
   Watch what happens: Claude edits the assertion, not `lib/capacity.ts` — the suite goes
   green, and the rule the test was supposed to prove now proves nothing.
6. Send the engineered version yourself.
   ```
   Make the failing test pass by changing lib/capacity.ts only. Do not edit
   the test file.
   ```
   Watch: the stub's logic changes, the test still says what it said, and it's green because
   the rule is now actually true.
7. Package the discipline. Create `.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`. This is the whole file.
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: tdd
   description: Run one red-green-refactor cycle for a rule from a spec in
     docs/specs/. Writes one failing test, the minimum code to pass it,
     refactors, then stops. Never edits an existing test.
   argument-hint: "<rule from docs/specs/*.md>"
   allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
   disable-model-invocation: true
   ---

   One cycle means one rule, or one new example of a rule already covered — not "keep going until
   the whole spec passes". Stop after REFACTOR and report; wait for the next `/tdd` call before
   starting another cycle.

   ## RED

   Write exactly one new failing test for the rule named in `$ARGUMENTS`, using its exact wording
   from the spec. Run `npm run test`.

   It must fail on an assertion — the wrong value, or the wrong branch taken — not on a compile or
   import error. A test that errors is testing plumbing, not the rule. If it already passes without
   any change, stop and say so instead of continuing.

   ## GREEN

   Write the minimum code to make that one test pass, in the file the rule belongs to. Run
   `npm run test` and confirm every test passes, not just the new one. Don't implement anything
   beyond what this test requires, and don't touch any other test — especially not the one you just
   wrote. If GREEN would require editing a test to pass, that's a sign the RED test was wrong; stop
   and say so instead of editing it.

   ## REFACTOR

   Clean up duplication in the code you just touched, in the test you just wrote, or both. Re-run
   the entire suite, not just the new test.

   ## STOP

   Report: the rule, the test file and name, pass or fail, and one sentence on what the next
   uncovered rule or example is. Then wait — don't start another cycle on your own.
   ```
   `disable-model-invocation: true` keeps this a call you make on purpose — Claude never
   reaches for it on its own.
8. Run `/tdd` for the second rule, end to end.
   ```
   /tdd must waitlist a join once capacity is reached
   ```
9. Run `/tdd` again for the boundary: one join *below* capacity still accepts, it doesn't
   waitlist early. A separate invocation.
   ```
   /tdd the counter-example under "must waitlist a join once capacity is
   reached" — one join below capacity still accepts
   ```
   Confirm it stops after one cycle instead of cascading through every remaining rule.
10. Run the gates.
    ```bash
    npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build
    ```

## Now you

Drive the remaining rule from the spec through `/tdd` on your own.

## Check

- [ ] The first red test failed on an assertion, not a compile or import error.
- [ ] You watched the careless prompt edit the test — you didn't send it yourself.
- [ ] The engineered prompt's fix never touched `lib/capacity.test.ts`.
- [ ] Every rule in `docs/specs/clash-capacity.md` has a passing test.
- [ ] You can say why `/tdd` sets `disable-model-invocation: true`.
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test` and `npm run build` are all green.

## Stuck?

`git checkout 11-start` — the reference CLASH with the task 06, 07, 09 and 10 files, vitest configured, one
trivial test passing, the capacity stub and the spec answer key in place, no rule
implementations yet.

## Go further

Compare with `workshop-artifacts/11-tdd-inner-loop/` in the workshop repository. Then sketch a
`spec-coverage` subagent (tools: Read, Grep, Glob) that checks every rule in `docs/specs/*.md`
has a passing test — read-only, same shape as task 08's `security-auditor`.
