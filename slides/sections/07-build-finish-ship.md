```txt
Review the diff of this branch against 05-start like a strict senior engineer.
Look for:
⟵ LIVE: the four things this repo cares about: ownership checks,
        Prisma outside lib/data, schemas outside lib/validation.ts,
        params not awaited
List findings with file and line. Fix nothing yet.
```

Next time, `/code-review` runs a check like this as one command.
