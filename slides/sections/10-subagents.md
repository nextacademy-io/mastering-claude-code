  Audit Server Actions in app/actions/ for missing ownership checks on

⟵ LIVE: write the brief as a property that can be true or false.
     For every exported Server Action that mutates an EXISTING row: does
     the code check that the current user owns it before mutating, not
     just that requireUser() ran? Report file, function, PASS/FAIL and
     the exact deciding line.
