```txt
Set up an agent team to audit app/actions/ for missing ownership checks.
Assign one teammate per domain: clashes, venues, participations, profile.
Each teammate should independently report PASS/FAIL per exported action in
their domain, citing the exact check (or its absence). If two teammates'
findings touch the same file, have them compare notes before the lead
finalizes the report.

⟵ LIVE: there is no YAML or JSON to fill in. A team is configured by
        describing it. Confirm the experimental flag is set before sending.

```txt
Write a dynamic workflow that audits every file in app/actions/ for
missing ownership checks on mutations of existing rows.

Phase 1 — discover every file in app/actions/.
Phase 2 — review each file independently in parallel, reporting
  suspected findings with file, function, and reasoning.
Phase 3 — for every finding, spawn a separate agent to try to refute
  it using only the code, not the original finding's reasoning. Drop
  any finding that doesn't survive.

⟵ LIVE: add the quarantine rule before sending. CLASH is full of
        user-supplied titles and bios. Agents that read untrusted content
        should not also hold write or delete tool access.
