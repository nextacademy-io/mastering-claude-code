Say:
- paths is the only field Claude Code reads from a rule file — everything else in the frontmatter is silently ignored
- No paths: field means it loads every session, same priority as CLAUDE.md itself

Say:
- Outside app/actions/ first — the rule stays absent, it hasn't loaded yet. Once it has, a
  later unrelated read won't unload it, so this check only proves anything done first
- Then the matching read — the rule appears: the ownership check from task 08's audit, now
  standing, not a one-off

Say:
- "Same finding, surfaced every time now, not just the one time someone thought to audit — still guidance, not enforcement"
