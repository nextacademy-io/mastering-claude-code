Say:
- Not needed to use Claude Code well — useful for understanding why it behaves the way it does
- [click] "Attention" is the mechanism: every token gets a say in how every other token is understood
- This is why the whole prompt costs tokens every turn, not just the new part

Say:
- Same architecture, different scale — bigger is not always better, it is slower and costs more
- [click] Sonnet is the default for a reason: fast enough, capable enough, for most of a working day
- [click] Reach for Opus when the reasoning is the hard part, not the typing
- [click] Fable is built for sessions you would normally break into pieces — hand it the outcome, not the steps
