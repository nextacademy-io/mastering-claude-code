<!-- @note: task-17-capstone -->
> Do:
> - Branch: 17-start already has CLAUDE.md, the skill, the fix and the hook set

Say:
- One brief, picked freely, and shipped end to end with every tool from the workshop

<!-- @note: capstone -->
> Do:
> - Walk around, look at /context readings
> - Ask people where their budget went

Say:
- Three briefs in workshop-artifacts/17-capstone/README.md: clash comments, venue favourites done properly, weekly digest
- No prompts given — the checklist is the deliverable

<!-- @note: security-three-rules -->
> Do:
> - Optional: point at "Protect against prompt injection" — the same three rules, as the docs' own core protections list

Say:
- Prompt injection in one sentence: a model cannot tell data from instructions by looking
- CLASH is full of user-supplied titles and bios — prime injection surface
- Task 12's workflow already applied the rule: readers of untrusted content do not hold write tools
- Hooks make that rule law
- Subagent tool lists make the attack surface small

<!-- @note: spec-kit-six-steps-one-constitution -->
> Do:
> - FULL WORKING SOLUTION (trainer only, install if demoing):
>   uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
>   specify init my-project
> - Repeat implement -> converge until convergence reports "Converged"

Say:
- GitHub's own tool, MIT, agent-agnostic — not tied to Claude Code
- On Claude Code every step installs as a namespaced skill: speckit-constitution, not a bare /constitution
- [click] /speckit-specify — a plain-language feature description
- [click] /speckit-plan — a technical plan from the spec
- [click] /speckit-tasks — the plan broken into a checklist
- [click] /speckit-implement — build against the task list
- [click] /speckit-converge — checks the build against the spec, loops back to implement until it reports Converged
- [click] The constitution runs once — principles every later step reads

<!-- @note: bmad-five-agents-one-party-mode -->
> Do:
> - Docs link: the BMAD repo README on GitHub — point at the five agents and the install line, then back to the slides
> - FULL WORKING SOLUTION (trainer only, install if demoing):
>   npx skills add bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD

Say:
- The delivery loop: clarify, plan, build and verify, learn and adjust — loops back to plan
- [click] PM — product priorities and scope
- [click] Architect — the technical shape of the solution
- [click] Developer — implementation
- [click] UX — the interface and the experience
- [click] Party Mode: every installed agent in one conversation, in character
- [click] bmad-build: the skill that turns one story into code — it clarifies the intent, plans, writes a spec, implements, then reviews; the link opens "Build a Change" at "Run bmad-build"

<!-- @note: spec-kit-vs-bmad -->
> Do:
> - Real prerequisite if someone only has Node

Say:
- [click:2] Spec Kit — GitHub, MIT, agent-agnostic, `specify init`, low ceremony
- Specs as version-controlled markdown any agent can consume
- Python/uv tool, not npm: `uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git`
- [click] BMAD v6 ships five named agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, UX Designer) — not "12+ personas" (that's a v4 figure)
- Heavyweight: reported real-world costs of hundreds to a couple of thousand dollars per developer per month on frontier models
- Repo: bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD
- Rule of thumb: Spec Kit when you want spec discipline without process overhead; BMAD when the organisation already has those roles
- BMAD will not conjure a process you do not have
- [click] Honest note: both are greenfield methods, CLASH is brownfield — that's why they come last, and why everything before was about control rather than ceremony
