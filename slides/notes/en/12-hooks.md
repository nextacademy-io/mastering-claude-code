Say:
- Naming trap: CLASH's `hooks/` folder is React hooks (one file, `use-mobile.ts`)
- Claude Code hooks live in `.claude/settings.json` — different things

<!-- @note: event-matcher-exit-code -->
> Do:
> - Open `.claude/settings.json`
> - Next slide turns that into a lesson, on purpose
> - Docs link: open it, scroll to "How hooks work", then back to the slides

Say:
- A hook needs three things: the EVENT, the MATCHER (which tool), the EXIT CODE — everything else is detail
- Critical rule: only exit code 2 blocks
- [click] On PreToolUse/PostToolUse, plain exit-0 stdout goes only to the debug log — Claude never sees it
- [click] What reaches the agent: stderr on exit 2, or structured JSON on stdout at exit 0
- Matcher matches the TOOL NAME, not a file path

<!-- @note: one-hook-slowly -->
> Do:
> - This is the DELIBERATE mistake — write it exactly as shown
> - Edit a file under `app/actions/` through Claude Code — nothing fires. Let it sit. Ask why.
> - Fix live with the sibling "if" field:
>   "matcher": "Edit|Write",
>   "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
>     "if": "Edit(app/actions/**)",
>     "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/typecheck-actions.sh",
>     "timeout": 60 }]
> - Then write `.claude/hooks/typecheck-actions.sh` (reference: `workshop-artifacts/10-hooks/`)
> - Introduce a type error into `app/actions/venues.ts` on purpose, through Claude Code, so the hook fires
> - Watch `tsc` fail, watch Claude get the failure on stderr, watch it fix its own code — the moment people remember

Say:
- Answer: matcher matches the TOOL NAME (Edit, Write, Bash), not a path — a path glob there is parsed as an unanchored regex against the tool name and never matches
- `if` holds exactly one permission rule — no `or`, no list. An `Edit(...)` rule covers every file-editing tool, so it catches Write too

<!-- @note: three-more-fast -->
> Do:
> - Move quickly — the idea is already in their heads

Say:
- [click:2] Output replacement: PostToolUse supports `hookSpecificOutput.updatedToolOutput` for ALL tools, not only MCP
- Use it to collapse a noisy `npm run build` log into one pass/fail line before it reaches context
- Same "context is a budget" argument, now applied to a hook instead of a CLAUDE.md rule

<!-- @note: pretooluse-deny-rules -->
> Do:
> - FULL WORKING SOLUTION (trainer only): `workshop-artifacts/10-hooks/settings.json`
> - Try editing a file under `prisma/migrations/`, watch the denial on screen

Say:
- Three separate matcher blocks, one per tool: Edit/Write for migrations, Bash for `rm`, Read for `.env`
- `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` values: allow/deny/ask — the plain exit-2 form works the same

<!-- @note: gate-the-turn -->
> Do:
> - FULL WORKING SOLUTION (trainer only): `workshop-artifacts/10-hooks/build-gate.sh`
> - Break the build on purpose, try to end the turn, watch Stop refuse and hand the failure tail to the agent
> - Fix, end the turn, watch it succeed
> - Name that distinction

Say:
- Wired under "Stop" with no matcher — Stop has no tool to match on
- Stop gates the end of a TURN, not a tool call

<!-- @note: advice-vs-law -->
> Do:
> - Foreshadow from the skills part pays off
> - Mention `hard_deny` in passing
> - Name it, don't configure it

Say:
- Skills are advice, hooks are law
- [click] A skill is what you tell a new colleague; a hook is what CI rejects
- If a CLAUDE.md rule keeps getting repeated and the agent keeps drifting past it, that rule wanted to be a hook
- `hard_deny` is `settings.autoMode.hard_deny`, part of auto mode where a classifier reviews actions instead of you — not a PreToolUse decision

<!-- @note: hooks -->
> Do:
> - Confirm people reproduced the broken matcher version before moving on
> - The "why didn't it fire" beat only lands if they saw the silence themselves
> - Close with `/hooks` live — a read-only browser, grouped by event: pick an event to see the hooks they just wrote under it
