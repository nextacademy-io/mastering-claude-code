# Mastering Claude Code — Facilitator guide

**Format:** guided workshop. You explain and show. Then participants do the task on their own
machine. You walk around (or watch the chat), help, and only move on when most are through
the "Check" list of the task.

**Codebase:** `github.com/pawsaw/clash`. Part I starts on `01-start` (spec only), Part II on `02-start`.
Parts III and IV run on the reference app from `06-start`.

**Spine:** the journey map (four belts) on the four part dividers, and the seven-primitive
toolkit map on the primitive dividers in Parts III and IV.

**Before the first session:** push the branches (`docs/BRANCHES.md`), confirm your own
machine passes `docs/SETUP.md`, confirm `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set and
Dynamic workflows are on in `/config`, pre-install the MCP servers, run the deck once
(`cd slides && npm run dev`).

**Rhythm for every task:** show the task slide, say the reset branch and how to open the task
file (link in the chat, printed sheet, or the repo README — your choice), demo the "Do this"
steps once on your screen, then hand over. Do not demo "Now you". While they work, keep the
task slide up. Close each task by asking two people what they saw.

**Pace:** favor running long over cutting a task short — consistent feedback says too little
time hurts more than too much. If a task is moving fast, stretch it: ask someone to walk the
group through their solution, or, if nobody has one yet, turn it into a problem the group
solves together. Plan a lunch break, plus a few short breaks along the way — set yourself a
reminder, it is easy to forget once everyone is deep in a task.

## Part I — Foundations

### What a model is

Go slowly here. This is where beginners decide whether the rest of the workshop is for them.

- **Tokens.** Type a sentence in a tokenizer if you have one; otherwise say it: "notifications"
  may be two or three tokens. Numbers and code split in odd places. This is why the model
  cannot count letters.
- **One token at a time.** The probability bars are the whole story: the prompt goes in, the
  top candidate comes out, that token joins the prompt, the bars change, repeat. Nothing is planned ahead. Say it twice.
- **Probabilities.** Same prompt, different answer. That is not a bug. Temperature is the
  spread. Claude Code runs with a fixed setting; you do not tune it.
- **Knowledge.** Trained once, on a snapshot. It does not read the internet now. If it needs
  a fact from today, something has to put that fact into the prompt.
- **No memory.** Every turn sends the whole conversation again. That is what "context" means.
  This is the single most important idea of the workshop. Everything in Parts III and IV is
  about managing what goes into that window.
- **The window is a budget.** Show the tank filling towards the red limit line. Past it, old
  things fall out or the run stops.
- **Bad at.** Counting, arithmetic, hidden state, current facts, checking its own work.
  The fix for all five is the same: give it a tool.
- **Tool call.** The model writes a small structured request and stops. Something else
  runs it. That "something else" is the next section.

### The harness

- Model alone: text in, text out. A function. The harness is the loop around it.
- Walk the cycle diagram station by station: build prompt, call model, permission, run tool,
  append result. The harness ring runs the tools; the model in the centre only chooses. Point
  at where the tool result goes: back into the prompt. That is why tool output costs context.
- What is in the prompt every turn: system prompt, CLAUDE.md, the tool list, the skills
  index, the history, your message. The part that repeats is cached. Cache is why the
  second turn is cheaper than the first.
- Permissions: the tool call waits at the gate until a rule or you say yes. Five modes: manual,
  accept edits, plan, auto, bypass. Plan mode is "no writes".
- Hooks: a shell command runs before or after a tool. Only exit code 2 matters: before a tool
  it blocks the call, after a tool it hands the error to the model. Say "we build
  these in Part IV".
- Subagents: a second loop with its own window. Only a summary comes back.
- Compaction: the full tank becomes a small summary block with room above it. Starting fresh
  empties it. Name the commands, don't run them yet — nobody has installed anything.
- Skills and MCP: one slide each, name them, point forward.
- Close: "The model is the same for everyone. The harness is where you win."

### First steps — Task 01

Demo: install, `claude`, `/help`, ask about `@docs/SPEC.md`, `/init`, `/clear`.
Watch for: people who never press Enter on the permission prompt; people who type in the
terminal while Claude is working (Esc stops it).

---

## Part II — Build CLASH

The build is the content. Every Claude Code basic is introduced exactly when the build needs it.
Participants' code will differ from the reference. That is fine. The reset branches are the
reference build at each stage.

### Task 02 — Foundation

- Teach the brief first: goal, constraints, done-when. Write one on screen before typing it.
- Start in manual mode. Read the first two or three permission prompts aloud, then switch to
  auto — scaffolding a Next.js app is standard, low-risk work. Let the group watch the tool
  calls scroll by and name them: Bash, Write, Read. Read the diff, not the summary.
- Plan mode for the data model. Show a plan being changed before it is accepted.
- First commit through Claude. Say: it writes the message, you approve.
- CLAUDE.md gets its first real invariants: Prisma client path, string statuses, async params.

### Task 03 — Auth and clashes

- Small steps beat big asks. Show one big ask failing (or drifting), then the same in three
  steps.
- `/rewind` after a wrong turn. Do this once on purpose.
- `/context` after the auth work. Read the numbers aloud. `/compact` and read them again.
- The page guard vs. the action: ask Claude to explain it, then add "every action checks
  ownership" to CLAUDE.md. This plants the seed for the audit in Part III.

### Task 04 — Venues, map, people

- "Do it like clashes" is the reuse pattern. Then the first custom slash command.
- Leaflet breaks on the server. Let Claude read the dev-server error and fix it. Do not
  fix it yourself.
- Paste a screenshot. Then let Claude look for itself with agent-browser. Both are input.
- Quality gates into CLAUDE.md. From here on, "done" means tsc, lint and build are green.

### Task 05 — Finish and ship

- Batch the independent work into one brief. Background tasks for the long ones.
- `/usage` once. Memory once (ask Claude to remember a rule, then `/memory`).
- Git through Claude: branch, commit, PR, a strict review prompt.
- Compare with the reference. Ask: what did the reference do that you did not? What did
  you do better? Then `git checkout 06-start`. Everyone is on the same code from here.

---

## Part III — Control the context

Parts III and IV run on the finished reference CLASH, as guided tasks.

### Task 06 — Context and CLAUDE.md

- `/context` is an instrument. Read it aloud.
- CLASH's real `CLAUDE.md` is `@AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md` is generic boilerplate. Nothing
  to trim. The exercise is authoring from real invariants.
- `@`-references vs. grep-and-guess. Plan mode for real-time notifications. `/skill-doctor`
  on `.agents/skills/` (two near-duplicate ~100KB skills).
- Answer key: `workshop-artifacts/06-context-and-claude-md/CLAUDE.md`. Do not show it before they write theirs.

### Task 07 — The clash-feature skill

- Progressive disclosure: name and description always loaded, body on match.
- Commands did not break: `.claude/commands/*.md` still works. Skills are the richer format.
- Build the skill step by step on screen. Stop at the Server Action step and say why it
  insists on its own ownership check. Then ship venue favourites with it and compare `/context`.
- A skill is advice. Hold that thought for hooks.

### Task 08 — Subagent audit

- Do not skip the setup: the layout guard protects the page, not the action. A Server
  Action is a public POST endpoint with a generated id. Zod validates shape, not permission.
- Say out loud: upstream `main` has no missing checks. The two are seeded on `08-start`
  (`deleteClash`, `deleteVenue`). `npm run lint` shows an unused `user` warning in
  `deleteVenue` as a tell.
- One `security-auditor` with Read/Grep/Glob and a falsifiable brief. `/context` barely
  moves. Fork vs. fresh: forks are on by default in interactive sessions.
- End on the cliffhanger: two findings, nothing fixed yet.

---

## Part IV — Orchestrate and let go

### Task 09 — Team and workflow audit

- Agent team: needs `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` or it silently spawns plain
  subagents. Teammates message by name via SendMessage. No `@`-mentions. `claude agents` is
  the background-sessions view, not a team dashboard. The moment to wait for: two peers
  disagree about the same file and the lead reconciles.
- Dynamic workflow: describe the job, Claude writes the script, the runtime runs it in the
  background. Read the generated script on screen. It lands under
  `~/.claude/projects/<session>/`; `s` in `/workflows` saves it to `.claude/workflows/`.
  `Date.now()`, `Math.random()` and no-arg `new Date()` throw inside it.
- Verifier/refuter and quarantine. Say the token cost out loud.
- Reconcile three results, fill the toolkit map from evidence, then restore the two
  `creatorId` checks. `workshop-artifacts/09-team-and-workflow-audit/AUTH-FIX.md` has the diff.
- Keep a finished run in a second terminal in case the live one is slow.

### Task 10 — Hooks

- Say the naming trap again: `hooks/` in CLASH is React hooks. Claude Code hooks live in
  `.claude/settings.json`.
- Event, matcher, exit code. Only exit 2 matters: it blocks before a tool or at Stop; after a
  tool it cannot block (the tool already ran) and the stderr goes to the model. Exit-0 stdout
  goes to the debug log only.
- The deliberate mistake: a path glob in `matcher` never fires. Let it sit. Fix with `if`.
- Watch the agent receive a blocked edit and fix its own type error. That is the moment.
- Then the deny set, output replacement (`hookSpecificOutput.updatedToolOutput`, all tools),
  and the Stop gate. `hard_deny` is an auto-mode setting, not a hook decision.
- Skills are advice. Hooks are law.

### Task 11 — The browser closes the loop

- MCP is a protocol boundary. Playwright MCP drives a browser; DevTools MCP speaks the
  DevTools protocol.
- Drive the join flow by hand first, then ask for the test file. Never generate tests blind.
- Avatars: `getCurrentUser()` selects `avatar` on every request. Measure, fix, re-measure.
- Four browser tools, one comparison. Do not quote a token-savings percentage for
  agent-browser; it is not an official number.

### Task 12 — Letting go

- Worktrees: `claude --worktree <name>`. The one thing they use next week.
- CI: `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` with `prompt` and `claude_args`. Not `@beta`,
  not a bare `claude -p` in the YAML. Token via a repository secret.

### Task 13 — Agent SDK

- Same loop, hosted in your program. Every primitive carries over: allowed tools, hooks,
  context budget.
- The script in `workshop-artifacts/13-agent-sdk/` answers one question about the seed data
  with Read, Grep and Glob only. Run it, then read it.

### Task 14 — Capstone

- Three briefs. Each participant picks one and ships it in a worktree with the skill, a
  subagent review, the hook set, a browser check and a PR.
- Close with security (prompt injection, quarantine, least privilege), Spec Kit vs BMAD
  (facts as corrected: Spec Kit is a Python/uv tool; BMAD v6 has 5 named agents), the
  "what we did not cover" slide, and the two lines: *context is king* and *you push it, you own it.*

## Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Beginners lost in the model section | Slow down. Every slide has one diagram and one sentence. Ask a question per slide. |
| Participants' builds diverge from the reference | Expected. Reset branches are the reference build. Say so at the start of Part II. |
| Scaffold fails on a machine | `git checkout 03-start` and continue. Do not debug installs in the session. |
| Dynamic workflows off on Pro | Everyone enables them in `/config` during setup. |
| Agent teams demo does nothing | Confirm the env flag on your machine before you start. It fails silently. |
| Typecheck hook does not fire | It is the scripted mistake. Make sure they saw the silence before the fix. |
| Slow workflow run | Second terminal with a finished run. The script read-through is the filler. |
| Token limits on Pro during Part IV | Warn early. Watch the trainer screen for that segment. Rejoin at the next branch. |
| Someone hand-edits `prisma/migrations` | The deny hook from Task 10 catches it from `11-start` on. |
