# Mastering Claude Code — workshop repository

A reusable, three-part-plus-one guided workshop on Claude Code: complete beginners build the
CLASH app with Claude Code, then learn to control and orchestrate it on the finished app.
Trainer: Adam Furmanczuk · nextacademy.io. Not tied to any event or date.

## Layout

- `README.md` — participant entry point. `FACILITATOR.md` — trainer guide.
- `docs/SPEC.md` — the CLASH product spec participants build from (no code).
- `docs/SETUP.md` — pre-flight. `docs/BRANCHES.md` — what every `NN-start` branch holds.
- `tasks/NN-slug.md` — one file per task, 01–19. `tasks/README.md` — index.
- `slides/` — one Slidev project, one deck. `slides/sections/*.md` are composed into `slides/slides.md`.
- `scripts/prepare-branches.sh` + `scripts/checkpoints/` — build the catch-up branches on a local CLASH clone. Never pushes.
- `workshop-artifacts/` — answer keys.
- `slides/scripts/lint-slides.mjs` — the content linter. "conference"/"Konferenz" are forbidden event words; the one exception is the product name `clash-conference` (a `(?<!clash-)` lookbehind), so prose says "talk" or "programme".
- `../clash-conference` (`https://github.com/agilino/clash-conference.git`) — a second repository for task 19, cloned next to the CLASH clone. Published once the app is finished; until then it holds no app and no `19-start` branch. Once out, its `main` is the finished app, its `19-start` is the app without `app/api/publish/route.ts`. Not built by `scripts/prepare-branches.sh`.

Target codebase: `https://github.com/pawsaw/clash` (Next.js 16 / React 19 / Prisma 7 + SQLite / shadcn / Leaflet).

## Hard rules (apply to every file)

1. **No times, no dates, no durations, no days.** Never write `00:15`, "35 min", "hour",
   "Day 1", "morning", "after the break", a year, or an event name. Structure is by part and task only.
2. **Simple language.** Short sentences. Everyday words. Explain a term in one line the first time it appears.
   Prefer less text. One idea per slide.
3. **Every path, command and file name is real.** Verify against the reference clone of CLASH before writing it.
   CLASH's `hooks/` folder holds React hooks; Claude Code hooks live in `.claude/settings.json`. Always say which one.
4. **Tasks follow the template below**, in this order, with these exact headings.
5. **Prompts are verbatim** in fenced code blocks. Never paraphrase a prompt in prose.
6. **`code-live` slides are skeletons** with `⟵ LIVE` markers. The full solution goes only in the presenter note.
7. **Facts about Claude Code that were verified against the Claude Code docs stay as verified**: only exit code 2 blocks a hook;
   hook `matcher` matches the tool name, path scoping uses the sibling `if` field; `if` holds exactly one permission rule
   (no `or`, no list) and an `Edit(...)` rule also covers `Write`; `hard_deny` is an auto-mode setting, not a hook decision;
   agent teams need `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`; teammates message by name via SendMessage, no `@`-mentions;
   a dynamic workflow's script lands under `~/.claude/projects/<session>/` first and only `s` in `/workflows` saves it to `.claude/workflows/`;
   `Date.now()`, `Math.random()` and no-arg `new Date()` throw inside a workflow script; headless CI uses `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`;
   custom commands (`.claude/commands/*.md`) merged into skills — a command file and a skill with the same name both produce the same
   `/name` and old command files keep working, but skills are the recommended path for new work;
   a project rule in `.claude/rules/*.md` reads only the `paths` frontmatter field — anything else there is ignored without an
   error — and a rule with no `paths` loads unconditionally, at launch, same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, while a
   `paths`-scoped rule loads only when Claude's Read tool matches the glob, not on every tool use; a skill's `context: fork`
   field runs it as a subagent with the skill body as its prompt, and `disable-model-invocation: true` blocks Claude from
   auto-triggering the skill while explicit `/name` invocation still works.
8. **File work in this repo uses Read, Write, Edit, Grep and Glob — never a shell command that reads,
   lists or searches files.** The shell is for the build and check commands under "Build and check"
   below, `git`, and `npx`/`npm`/`node`. A `PreToolUse` hook (`.claude/hooks/no-shell-file-reads.sh`)
   blocks the rest.
9. **Every subagent brief for read-only work names its tools**, e.g. `tools: Read, Grep, Glob` in
   `.claude/agents/repo-explorer.md`. A subagent inherits this file but never the parent session's
   auto-memory — a constraint that matters belongs in the agent file or the brief, not only in memory.

10. **Name the repository and the app every time.** Task 19 works in two clones at once, so
    "the clone", "the repo", "the root", "the app" and "this project" on their own are wrong.
    Write **your CLASH clone** and **clash-conference**. The same for what is running: CLASH
    serves `localhost:3000`, clash-conference serves `localhost:3001` — name the app wherever a
    port, a URL, a `.env` file, a `.claude/settings.json` or a branch appears. Both repositories
    have a branch called `19-start`; never write it without saying which one.

## Task template

```
# Task NN — Title
> Part: <part name> · Reset branch: `NN-start`
> Slides: https://mastering-claude-code.vercel.app/task-NN

## Theory
- [Exact slide heading](https://mastering-claude-code.vercel.app/theory-example)

> **Reminder:** One sentence with the key idea to carry into the task.

## You will end up with
## Why
## Do this
## Now you
## Check
## Stuck?
## Go further
## Links
```

- **Theory**: one to three links to the exact slide headings this task depends on. Use stable `theory-*`
  route aliases, keep the Markdown link text identical to the slide heading, then add one short **Reminder**.
- Start new task files with `npm run task:new -- 15 My new task`; omit the number to use the next available task number.
- **Do this**: numbered steps. Each step is one action. Exact commands and exact prompts in code blocks.
  Say what the participant should see after the step.
- **Now you**: the same shape again on a new target. State the goal. Give no prompt. One to four items.
- **Check**: checkboxes a participant can verify by looking.
- **Stuck?**: `git checkout NN-start` and one line on what that branch contains.
- **Go further**: one open extension, no steps.
- **Links**: official docs only, verified live.

## Slide rules

- Layouts: `concept` (graphic + ≤ 3 lines), `code-live` (skeleton), `task-intro` (opens a task
  block: title, `git checkout`, "You learn" / outcome columns — this is the `routeAlias:
  task-NN` link target), `task` (closes it: the recap, with goal, success, reset branch),
  `section` (divider with `JourneyMap`, plus `ToolkitMap` in the control/orchestrate parts).
- Concept slides: ≤ 40 words of body text. Headings ≤ 8 words.
- Diagrams are small Vue/SVG components in `slides/components/` (`D*.vue` for the LLM and harness ideas, `G*.vue` for the rest). Text inside SVG is never under 13 px.
- Presenter notes are authored in `slides/notes/en/` and `slides/notes/de/` (one file per section, one
  `<!-- @note: key -->` block per slide, key = `slugify(heading)`) and hold the trainer script: what to say,
  what to demo, what to watch for. `slides/scripts/deck.mjs` splices each block into its slide as an
  `<!-- -->` comment at build time — that generated form is what Slidev reads, not what you author. No times.
- Every task block, in this order, inside one section file: `task-intro` → every concept/code-live
  slide the task needs → an optional "stop slide" (`G03CarelessVsEngineered`, a live
  careless-vs-engineered demo — only where the task has a real contrast, never forced) → `task`
  recap → an optional debrief (content that only makes sense once the task is done, e.g. quality
  gates). `task-intro` carries `routeAlias: task-NN`; the `task` recap never does — one link
  target per task, at the top of its block, not the bottom.
- `task-intro` frontmatter: `number` (matches `tasks/NN-*.md`), `routeAlias` (`task-NN`),
  `heading` (`"Task NN — Title"`), `branch`, `learn` (string list, the Claude Code mechanisms
  taught), `outcome` (string list, what gets built), `outcomeHeading` (optional, `"You build"`
  in Part II, otherwise omitted). `task` (recap) frontmatter: `number`, `heading`, `goal`, `mode`
  (`you do` | `watch first`), `success`, `branch`. No QR code and no task URL on any task slide
  beyond the `task-intro` routeAlias: the trainer never reads a URL aloud, they open `/task-NN`.
- The task file's own `## Theory` section (stable `theory-*` route aliases on individual
  concept/code-live slides, one to three links back from the task file) is a separate mechanism
  from `task-intro`/`task` and coexists with it: `task-intro` is the slide-side overview a
  participant sees watching the deck; `## Theory` is the task-file-side deep link for someone
  who skips the slides.
- Docs links: a `docs:` frontmatter field normally holds one official English Claude Code docs URL (`https://code.claude.com/docs/en/…`). When the slide's mechanism belongs to a third-party tool Claude Code consumes, not a Claude Code feature itself, `docs:` may instead hold that tool's own official page — each one a deliberate addition to the allowlist in `slides/scripts/lint-slides.mjs`, never an arbitrary URL. The `concept`, `code-live` and `section` layouts draw it bottom-right as a chain icon plus the word "docs" (`slides/components/DocLink.vue`) — bottom-right because Slidev's navigation bar pops up bottom-left. Never a `<DocLink>` tag in a slide body, never on a `task` or `task-intro` slide. Use it sparingly, where a mechanism is first explained. The slide's presenter note names what to scroll to or point at, and the same URL is in that task's `## Links`.

## Parts

- Part I — Foundations (White belt): what a model is, the harness, first steps. Task 01.
- Part II — Build CLASH (Blue belt): tasks 02–05. Participants build CLASH from `docs/SPEC.md`.
- Part III — Control the context (Brown belt): tasks 06–10, on the reference CLASH (`06-start`).
- Part IV — Orchestrate and let go (Black belt): tasks 11–19.

## Build and check

Driving agent-browser by hand: run `agent-browser skills get core` first for the command reference.

```bash
cd slides && npm install && npm run build      # also exports dist/mastering-claude-code.pdf
node slides/scripts/lint-slides.mjs            # no times, slugs match, LIVE markers present, docs links follow the convention
node slides/scripts/check-notes-parity.mjs     # notes/en and notes/de: same keys, same [click] markers, same commands and paths
node slides/scripts/check-doc-links.mjs        # needs network: every docs link is still in the docs index, every #anchor has a heading
slides/scripts/check-slides.sh                 # agent-browser overflow check per slide
node --test .claude/hooks/no-shell-file-reads.test.mjs  # the no-shell-file-reads hook, including
                                                # the settings.json dispatcher end-to-end
```
